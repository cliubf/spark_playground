# [UROP Summer 2018] A local spark set up guide with example usage

## Introduction
For this summer, I have been struggling with local spark setup and tried many ways in setting up spark at my local PC. Therefore, I decided to write down my experience, hoping that this would help future UROP students in this topic spend less time in setting up local spark and get more time to play with spark. Feel free to leave me a issue if you are confused with local spark setup.



Even if you are not a UROP participant and happened to pass by my GitHub repository, you are also welcomed to leave me a issue, as long as you are in hope of finding some reference with local spark installation.



If you find some mistakes or points worthy to mention or improve, please, do not hesitate to leave a issue.

## Local Spark setup
* [Zeppelin on Ubuntu](local_spark_setup/zeppelin_ubuntu.md)
* [Jupyter notebook on Windows](local_spark_setup/jupyter_windows.md)
* [Zeppelin on MacOS](https://dziganto.github.io/anaconda/shiro/spark/zeppelin/zeppelinhub/How-To-Locally-Install-Apache-Spark-And-Zeppelin/)
  * I did not try out this on mac; however, on Ubuntu, the same pipeline worked.
* [Failed attempts](local_spark_setup/failed_cases.md)

## Spark MLlib mini project
* [Comprehensive pipeline of analysis](notebooks/attrition_comprehensive.ipynb)
* [Problem identification](notebooks/attrition_simple.ipynb)
* [Most straight forward pipeline](notebooks/attrition_final.ipynb)

## Others
